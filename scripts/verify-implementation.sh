echo "=== Verification Complete ==="
echo
echo "🎉 ContainerYard has been successfully updated with:"
echo "   • Host summary endpoint for live dashboard tiles"
echo "   • cAdvisor support for remote container monitoring"
echo "   • piapps2 configuration as CADVISOR_ONLY host"
echo "   • Updated frontend with live data polling"
echo
echo "📋 Next steps:"
echo "   1. Deploy cAdvisor on piapps2 (if not already done)"
echo "   2. Access ContainerYard dashboard"
echo "   3. Select 'Pi Apps 2 (piapps2)' from host dropdown"
echo "   4. Verify tiles show live CPU/Memory data"
echo "   5. Verify containers list appears for piapps2"
echo
echo "🔧 Manual testing commands:"
echo "   # Test summary endpoint (after login)"
echo "   curl -b 'cy.sid=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE' http://localhost:5008/api/hosts/piapps2/summary"
echo "   # Test containers list (after login)"
